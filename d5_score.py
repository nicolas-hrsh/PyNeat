# Start with this:  
students = [("Alice", 95), ("Bob", 87)]  
# 1. Add new student ("Charlie", 92)  
students.append(("Charlie", 92))

# 2. Update Bob's score to 90 
      #ANS: CANNOT UPDATE BEACUSE IT IS A TUPLE!

# 3. Why is this structure good?  
      #ANS: BECAUSE ONCE THE SCORE IS ENTERED, IT CANNOT BE TEMPERED WITH!
